This directory contains an example for a complete 3 axis machine. 
The motors are closed loop servos driven with 2FOC boards using 
RTCAN communication. Using a Zedboard with CAN8 interface in point 
to point CAN configuration is possibile to close the position loop 
at up to 3KHz frequency.

The following comp files from 'halrun' examples are needed: 
  posfromencoder.comp
  u32_bus_to_wires.comp

the configuration includes:
 - GPIO for E-Stop, Limit switches, jog wheel
 - rtcan controlled servodrives (CSV - cyclic sync velocity mode)
 - drivers status/error LEDs with pyvcp
